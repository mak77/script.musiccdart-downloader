# script.musiccdart.downloader
Kodi script add-on to download music CDArt

The script uses MusicBrainz and Fanart.tv web services to add cdart.png to albums.

Albums must be organized in folders (one for each album), all the album files must have a valid musicbrainz_album_id.
You can use MusicBrainz Picard to properly tag your albums (https://picard.musicbrainz.org/).

Please contribute back missing contents to MusicBrainz (https://musicbrainz.org/) and Fanart.tv (https://fanart.tv/)
